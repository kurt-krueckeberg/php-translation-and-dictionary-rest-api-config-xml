## Design

Put the xml provder string into the ClassID by re-enabling the `get_config` interface. OR: use the Enumeration case??() function to get the specific case like Leipzig as a string.

I could use a sinlge config.xml file???

## Comparison of Azure vs Systran

Systran is preferred ove Azure. When you compare Azure definitions (with examples) to Systran definitions (with expressions), it is obvious the Systran definitions are more extensive. Systran outweighs the example phrases that Azure sometimes
provided for a definition. 

## CSS sytling of definition results: 

- [PONS DE -> EN](https://en.pons.com)

See [doc/pons-html-output.png](doc/pons-html-output.png)

Pons uses <dl>'s -- definition list? -- to markup its table-display of dictionary results. A <dt> is the left colum and a <dl> is the right column.
You can use Chrome's inspector to copy the CSS styles. Just right click, then do  -> Copy CSS Styles.
